## Readme for Operating System (CSE 231) Bonus Assignment

### [**Shivansh Choudhary - 2020127**]

## Description
In the whole project, we have to implement the following logic:
Each philosopher is denoted by a thread. Each philosopher will take a fork from the table and then wait for the other philosophers to finish their meal. If the fork is not available, the philosopher will wait for the fork to become available. If the fork is available, the philosopher will start eating and then put the fork back to the table. The philosophers will continue to do this until they finish their meal. 
There will be no deadlock in any of the three cases. 
Since the bowls are only 4, the four philosophers will be able to eat from the same bowl and one philosopher will wait for the other philosophers to finish their meal.
